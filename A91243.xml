         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

our oppoſites dare not deny their <hi>Miniſtery and Apoſtleſhip</hi>
to be lawfull, being not of men, but of Gods and Chriſts
own call, without the peoples. Secondly, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that all Hereditary Kingdomes, which (<hi>g</hi>) Polititians
and Divines generally hold the beſt of Governments, all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and Commiſſions in all Empires, Kingdomes and States
of the world creating Princes, Dukes, Earls, Lords, and ſuch
like <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> whereby they are inabled in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kingdomes to ſit in their Parliaments and Aſſemblies of
State, and for creating <hi>Privy Counſellors, Judges, Juſtices and
other Magiſtrates</hi> are void, null and illegall, and ſo all the
Lawes, Orders, Ordinances made, Acts done and Judgements
given by them,<note place="margin"> 
                  <hi>d</hi> See M. Seldens Titles of Honor.</note> are void and erroneous, becauſe they were
not choſen and called to theſe places and publike Counſells
and Judicatures by the people, but by the Emperours, Kings,
and Supreme Governours of State, and what a confuſion
ſuch a Paradox as this would breed in all our Kingdomes,
and in all States and Kingdomes in the world, let wiſe men
conſider, and thoſe fools too who make this Objection.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, if there be no lawfull Authority in any
State, but from the Peoples immediate election, then it will
neceſſarily follow, that Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ax</hi> is no lawfull
<hi>Generall,</hi> his <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Councell of Warre</hi> no lawfull Officers

no lawfull Colonell or Lievtenant Colonell, and ought not

to uſe or retaine theſe titles, as they do, becauſe none of
them were called and choſen to thoſe places by the People,
but made ſuch by Commiſſion from the Parliament.</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, This paradox of theirs, touching the peoples
choice and call to inable Peers to ſit in Parliament, or beare
any office of Magiſtracy or Judicature, is warranted by no
<hi>law of God,</hi> in old or new <hi>Teſtament,</hi> both which contradict
it: by no Lawes or Statutes of theſe Kingdomes or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which abſolutely diſclaime it, and enact the contrary:
by no preſcription, cuſtome or uſage, which are all againſt
it; by no Originall Law of Nature, which as all<note n="e" place="margin">Ariſt. Polit. l. 1. Bodin. de Repub. l. 1. c. 2. 3, 4, 5. <hi>D. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Father</hi> a <hi>Magiſteriall</hi> and <hi>Judiciall</hi> rule and power over
his children, progeny, Family; and makes him a <hi>King,

Father <hi>and firſt-borne</hi> of the family, being both the <hi>King,
Prince and Lord over it, and Prieſt to it from the Creation till
the</hi> Law was given, as is generally acknowledged by all
Divines.</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, I anſwer, that a particular, explicit actuall
choice and election by the people, of any to be Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
Judges, Miniſters, Peeres or Members of Parliament,
is neither neceſſary nor convenient to make them juſt and
lawfull, except onely when the Lawes of God, of Nature,
of Nations, or the Kingdome expreſly require it; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a generall implicit or tacit conſent; eſpecially when the
ancient Lawes of the Land continuing ſtill in full force, and
the cuſtome of the Kingdome time out of mind, requires no
ſuch ceremony of the peoples particular election or call; in
which caſe the peoples diſſent is of no validity, till that Law
&amp; cuſtome be repealed by general conſent of the King, Lords
and Commons in Parliament.<note place="margin">* Seldens <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> part 2. Cook 4. Inſtit. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and if the Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Realme were, that the

ſome ages without repeale, this Law and Cuſtome were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make ſuch Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes lawfull
Members of Parliament, and to repreſent the Commons of
England without any election of the people, the Laws made
by our Anceſtors in Parliament,<note place="margin">See Littleton, Fitz-Herbert, Brut. &amp; Aſhly. Tit. VVarranty. Obligat. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp;c.</note> obliging their poſterity

            <p>4. If all <hi>Power in Government, and right of ſitting, judging,

upon the immediate free election of all thoſe that are to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned;

reaſons againſt the <hi>Lords Iuriſdiction,</hi> then it will of
neceſſity follow; that the orders, Votes, Ordinances and
Lawes made by or conſented to by the Knights, Citizens and
Burgeſſes in Parliament, ought not to bind any Miniſters,
Women, Children, Infants, Servants, Strangers, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
Citizens, Burgeſſes, Artificers, or others, (who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well or properly be repreſented but by perſons of their

calling in each County and Corporation in England ſhould
ſend Members of their own to Parliament to repreſent them)
but only ſuch Freeholders, and Burgeſſes who had voices in
and gave free conſent to their Elections, not any who have
no voyces by Law, or diſſented from thoſe elected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
yea then it will neceſſarly follow; that thoſe
Counties, Cities and Burroughs whoſe Members have been
injuriouſly impeached, ſuſpended, driven away, or thruſt
out of the Houſe of Commons by the objectors and the
Armies practiſe and violence (contrary to all former preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents)
are abſolutely free, exempted and not bound by any
Votes or Ordinances made, or taxes impoſed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Houſe, becauſe they have no Members to repreſent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116421:9"/>
them reſiding in Parliament; and that thoſe Counties and
Burroughs whoſe Knights and Burgeſſes are dead or abſent
are no wayes obliged by any Votes, Ordinances, or Grants
in Parliament: And then how few in the Kingdome will or
ought to yeeld obedience to any the Acts, Ordinances, or
Votes of this preſent Parliament, or to any Mayors, Sheriffes
Aldermen, or Heads of Houſes made by their Votes and
Authority, (uſually made by election heretofore) or to
any Iudges, Juſtices, Governours, Generalls, Captains, or

without the generality of the peoples Votes,

of the Members were abſent or driven from both Houſes,
by the Objectors violence and menaces.</p>
            <p>Theſe Anſwers premiſed, I ſhall now proceed to the
proofe of the Lords undeniable Right and Authority to
ſit, Vote, and give Judgement in Parliament, though not
actually elected and called by the people, as Knights and
Burgeſſes are.</p>
            <p>1. It is evident, by the Hiſtories, Republikes of moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

that their Princes, Nobles, Peers and great Officers of State,

Secondly, By, and in the very primitive conſtitution of our

Spirituall, Archbiſhops and Biſhops, being in number 24. who ſit there in

The third eſtate are the Commons of the Realme, whereof there bee
Knights of Shires or Counties, Citizens of Cities &amp; Burgeſſes of Burro.
All which are reſpectively by the Shires or Counties, Cities &amp; Buroughs by
force of the Kings writ, <hi>Ex debito Juſtitiae;</hi> and none of them ought to be

obſerved that when there is beſt appeareance, there is the beſt ſucceſſion in

In the Parliament of 21 <hi>Edw. 3. no. 45. William de Thorpe</hi>

The <hi>firſt concerning the Wars which the King had undertaken by the

The <hi>ſecond, how the Peace of</hi> England <hi>may be kept. Whereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
King would the Commons ſhould conſult together, and that within
four daies they ſhould give anſwer to the King and His Counſell what
they think therein. On the fourth day the Commons declare,</hi> THAT
THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO COUNSEL ANY THING
TOUCHING THE POINT OF WAR; wherefore they deſire
<hi>in that behalf to be excuſed: And that the King will thereof</hi> AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VISE
WITH HIS NOBLES AND COUNCEL; <hi>and what ſhall
be ſo amongſt them determined they the Commons will thereto aſſent,

            <p>
               <hi>In the Parliament of</hi> 5 Hen. 4. Rot. Parl. num. 9. 10. <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
having preſented to the King in Parliament divers grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116421:18"/>
in the ill managing of His Revenues, the decay of His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Houſes, and Parks; the great poverty and preſſures of His
Subjects, and danger of the Enemies: thereupon</hi> they moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
and cordially prayed the King to conſider the eminent perils of
all parts of the Realm by reaſon of the Enemies and Rebels, of which
they had news from day to day, and that as the caſe then ſtood, if ſuch
miſchiefs were not ſpeedily and graciouſly remedied and reformed in
this Parliament, it might fall out upon ſodain arivall of Enemies, or
by ſome other means this Parliament muſt of neceſſity be departed
from by all and diſſolved, ſo as the Lords and Commons ſhould never
re-aſſemble again to redreſſe the ſaid Miſchiefs and others, which
God defend. And therefore that it would pleaſe the King conſidering
the <hi>HIGH WISDOMES AND DISCRETIONS OF THE</hi>
LORDS, <hi>and that THEY HAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY
PERILS AND MATTERS</hi> which could not be ſo clearly known
to the King, <hi>that he would now in this</hi> preſent Parliament charge
<hi>ALL HIS</hi> LORDS Spirituall and Temporall, upon the faith
they principally owe to God, and the faith, Homage and Allegiance
which they owe to our Lord the King himſelf, for the aid and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of themſelves, and of all the Realm, that the ſaid Lords <hi>WOULD
COUNSEL</hi> and ſhew Him their advice and <hi>WHOLSOME COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEL
IN THIS BEHALF SEVERALLY &amp; INTIRELY</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſſimulation, or adulation, having regard to the great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and neceſſity aforeſaid. And thereupon our Lord the King
most graciouſly, with His own mouth in full Parliament, charged
and commanded as well the Lords, as the ſaid Commons, that they
ſhould do their diligence, and ſhew unto Him their good and wholſome
Counſels in this behalf, for the aid of Him and all His Realm. And
after the ſaid Commons in the ſame Parliament, made requeſt to the
ſaid Lords, that ſeeing the King had given them ſuch a charge and
command, and that in ſo high a manner of Record, that they would do
their diligence well and loyally, to perſever the ſame without any
courteſie made between them in any manner, as they would anſwer
before the most High, and before our Lord the King, and to all the
Realm in time to come; and that the Commons themſelves thereupon
would do the like on their party. Which if both Lords and Commons
would now cordially and ſincerely promiſe and ingage to do, without
ſelf-ends or intereſts, we might ſee our Church and Kingdome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116421:19"/>
ſetled in a peaceable and happy condition. <hi>In brief,</hi> the <hi>Lords in
the very Writ touching Knights and Burgeſſes, are ſtiled,</hi> The
Common Councell of the Kingdome, <hi>and the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgeſſes, are called,</hi> to inform and aſſent to that which they and
their King ſhall Ordain, <hi>and 5 Ric. 2. Parl. 2. n. 3. 6 R. 2. n.</hi> 8, 9, 11,

OF</hi> LORDS <hi>by waging of their extraordinary wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and abilities. And therefore moſt fit to ſit, vote, and judge
in Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lords and great Officers of the Realme, as ſuch
were ever reputed perſons of greateſt <hi>Valour, Courage, Power,</hi> (in
regard of their great intereſts, Eſtates, allies, and retainers) and
ſo beſt able to withſtand, and redreſſe all publike grievances, and
enchroachments, of the King upon their owne and the peoples
Liberties, in defence whereof they have in ancient times been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
moſt ready and active to ſpend not only their eſtates, but
blood and lives for, wherewith they have redeemed and preſerved
thoſe Liberties and Freedomes we now enjoy and contend for.
And in this regard our anceſters in point of wiſdome, policy and
right, thought meet, that they ſhould alwayes be ſommoned to,
and bear chief ſway in our Parliaments, in reſpect of their Peerage,
Power and Nobility only without the peoples election. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their ſitting in Parliament, we find expreſly recorded in
<hi>Bracton,</hi> l. 2. c. 16. fol. 34. and in <hi>Fleta,</hi> l. 1. c. 17. <hi>The King</hi> (ſay they)
<hi>hath a Superiour,</hi> namely, <hi>God; alſo the Law, by which He is made a
King; likewiſe His Count,</hi> to wit, THE <hi>EARLS</hi> &amp; <hi>BARONS,
becauſe they are called Counts as being the KINGS</hi> FELLOWS, <hi>and

            <p>By all which premiſſes it is moſt apparent, That our Lords and
Barons ſitting and voting in Parliament, (who if you take them
poll by poll, have in all ages been more able Parliament men, and
States-men in all reſpects, then the Commons, though choſen by
the people, who alwayes make choice of the beſt and wiſeſt men,

            </p>
            <p>Firſt our Hiſtories, Law-books and Records agree, that in ancient
times, our <hi>Earls,</hi> who were called <hi>Comites,</hi> or <hi>Counts</hi> from the word
<hi>County,</hi> had the chief <hi>Government and Rule of moſt of the Counties of
this Realmne</hi> under the King, and that they, and the Barons were the
<hi>proper Judges</hi> of the common peoples Cauſes in the Tournes, County-Courts,
<hi>County Barons;</hi> even by vertue of their <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi>
as our <hi>Sheriffes</hi> have now; in which Courts they did <hi>inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Lawes of the Land;</hi> and adminiſter Juſtice to them in all
ordinary and criminall cauſes. For proof whereof you may peruſe
at leaſure, M. <hi>Seldens</hi> Titles of Honour, Part 2. c. 5. Sect. 5. Sir. <hi>Edw.

Commons and People in the Country, by reaſon of their Honours &amp;
Dignities, even in ancienteſt times, in ordinary Cauſes; there was
great right and reaſon too, they ſhould be ſo, their Judges alſo in all

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The Lords, Peers, and great Officers of State, in reſpect
of their education, learning and experience in all proceedings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and State affaires, are better able, and more fit to be Judges of
Parl then ordinary Citizens and Burgeſſes for the moſt part (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

which they ſerve, as anciently they were, and ſtill ought to be by the

            <p>To which objection I anſwer; Firſt, that this is no Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
as Sir <hi>Edwards Cooke</hi> miſtakes, but a bare Proteſtation
of the Lords, without Kings or Common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

againſt ſuch as were no Peers, in caſes triable elſe-where,</hi> and not
proper for their tribunall (as the Objectors hence conclude) is
quite to miſtake their meaning, and to ſpeak rather non-ſence,
then reaſon or Law. Fourthly, This Proteſtation was made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt the Lords giving ſentence in <hi>Felony</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and
that <hi>in the Kings own preſence in Parliament</hi> (who uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the <hi>Judgement</hi> himſelf, with the <hi>Lords aſſent</hi> and did not
charge the Lords to pronounce it, as here hee did) not againſt
ſentencing, fining and impriſoning any Commoner for rayling
and Lybelling againſt their Perſons. Juriſdiction, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
refuſing to anſwer, and contemning their Authority to
their faces at the Barre; and appealing from their Judicature
in caſe of breach of Priviledge of which themſelves alone and

whoſe commitments are warranted by hundreds of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,

is a manifeſtation of their injudiciouſneſſe and folly rather
then a juſtification of their <hi>Libellous Invectives</hi> againſt the Lords

the ſaid Earle ought to make fine and ranſome at the will of the King.

to the <hi>Statnte</hi> of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. yet the <hi>Lords only by Proteſtation

becauſe that the writ of ſummons of Parliament returned by the

for the ſaid Parliament and not returned by the ſaid Sheriffe. And
the ſaid parties being duely examined, and their reaſons well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in the ſaid Parliament,</hi> IT WAS AGREED BY THE SAID

being then unable to relieve them, or puniſh theſe breaches, by
their owne authority, as of late they preſume to doe without
King or Lords; <hi>Quo Jure</hi> (having not the power of Judicature
veſted in them) I am yet to learne, being contrary to the practice
and preſidents of all ancient Parliaments before our preſent age;
and the Statute of 11. <hi>H. 6. c.</hi> 11. provided for this very purpoſe,
which preſents another remedy out of Parliament, and not in
only the Commons houſe.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament of 16. <hi>R. 2. n.</hi> 6. The Wedneſday after the
Parliament began Sir <hi>Philip Courtenay</hi> returned by the Sheriffe
of <hi>Devon</hi> for one of the Knights for that County<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> came before
the King in full Parliament and ſayd, that he underſtood how
certaine people had accuſed and ſlandered him to the King and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116421:32"/>
Lords, as well by Bill as by mouth, of heinous matters; and
therefore prayed TO BE DISCHARGED OF THE SAID IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLOYMENT,
untill the ſaid accuſations and complaints were
tried, and found true, or not true: and becauſe his ſaid prayer
ſeemed honeſt TO THE KING and THE LORDS, THE KING
GRANTED HIM HIS REQUEST, and DISCHARGED
HIM IN FULL PARLIAMENT. AND the Monday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at the inſtance and prayer of the COMMONS the KING
GRANTED THAT HE SHOULD BE RESTORED and RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITTED
TO HIS PLACE according to the returne of the
ſaid Sheriffe, for to counſell and doe that which belonged unto
his office; and after becauſe he had been good and treatable with
thoſe who had complained upon him, and condeſcended to a good
treaty, he was reſtored in full Parliament to his good ſame. The
charge againſt him is expreſſed in the ſame Parliament rol. num.
13. 14. where two Petitions preferred againſt him to THE
KING and LORDS IN PARLIAMENT, for putting <hi>Thomas

no poore man durſt to ſue him. Which Petitions were referred
by conſent in Parliament to certaine Arbitrators to determine.</p>
            <p>From which record it is evident, Firſt, that Members of the
Commons houſe may be complained and petitioned againſt for
miſdeameanours, and put to anſwer before the King and Lords
in Parliament, and there fined and judged (not before the
Commons houſe) and that this was the antient way of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Secondly, that the Commons cannot ſuſpend or diſcharge
any of their fellow-Commoners or Knights from ſitting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but only the King and Lords in full Parliament, in
whom the power of Judicature reſts: much leſſe then can
they expell or eject any of their members by their owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
without the Kings and Lords concurrence and conſents.
Thirdly, that the power of reſtoring and readmitting a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Member of the Commons houſe belongs not to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
themſelves, but to the King and Lords, to whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
themſelves in this caſe addreſſed themſelves by petitinn
for Courtneys readmiſſion unto his office, after his ſubmiſſion
of the complaints againſt him to the arbitriment of thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to whom the King and Lords referred the ſame.</p>

In the Parliament of 17. R. 2. n. 23. It was accorded by the King

ſhould not be delivered out of priſon wherein he was detained for

               <hi>In the Parliament of</hi> 35. Eliz. <hi>when Sir</hi> Edward Cook <hi>was Speaker

the</hi> Houſe could not amend it, but the Lord Keeper in Chancery, where
the return was of Record, <hi>if he thought it</hi> amendable by Law; and
that Masten Speaker ſhould wait upon the Lord Keeper about it, <hi>which

                  </gap> Utlagatum;</hi> Whereupon he petitioned the Houſe,
that he might have a Writ of Priviledge and <hi>be enlarged.</hi> After
many dayes debate and Argument of this caſe in the Houſe by
ſundry Lawyers, and Sir <hi>Edward Cooke,</hi> then Speaker, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116421:34"/>
That <hi>no Writ of Priviledge could in this caſe be returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Houſe of Commons, being but a Member of Parliament, and
no Court of Record, but only into the Chancery or Houſe of Peers;
And that this being a point of Law it was meet the Iudges ſhould be
adviſed with, and determine it, not the Houſe:</hi> And at laſt he was
outed of his Priviledge by the Houſes reſolution. In 28. <hi>H. 8.
Dyer</hi> 60. The caſe of <hi>Trewinnerd</hi> a Commoner, in point of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament concerning an arreſt, was argued and
debated before the Judges in the Kings Bench: And ſo was <hi>Ched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
caſe in 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12. 13. So as the Commons only are not the
ſole Judges of ſuch Priviledge (as many now concerve) but the
Houſe of Peers, and Kings Councell, and Judges as well as they.
In theſe three caſes only, and no other that I find, Sir <hi>Edward
Cooke</hi> admits the Commons to be <hi>ſole Iudges</hi> now (though not
anciently) without the Lords. Therefore to extend it generally
to all, or any other caſes of Commoners, but theſe is to pervert
his words, and extend them farre beyond his meaning. Now <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnes</hi>
&amp; <hi>Overtons</hi> Caſes are none of theſe, but directly under the
<hi>Lords ſole Iudicature,</hi> becauſe <hi>infringements of their Priviledges,</hi> of
which <hi>the Lords only are the Iudges,</hi> as the Commons pretend they
are of their <hi>Priviledges;</hi> as his following paſſages manifeſt.
Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee addes; that <hi>both Houſes together have power of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,</hi>
but determines not in what caſes, nor in what way
of Judicature, which hath cauſed the Object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But the Judgements, <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Iournals</hi> of Parliament to
which he refers, and the caſes he cites in the Margin, will affoyle
this doubt, and cleare his meaning, which is this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>in attainders</hi> and judgements <hi>of High Treaſon, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,</hi>

And ſo not departing from his ſaid Anſwers, ſubmitted
himſelfe wholly to the Kings Rule and Governance, without putting
himſelfe upon his Peerage. Where thus the Chancellour told him
That as touching the great and horrible things contained in the firſt
Bill, the King holdeth him neither declared nor charged. And as
touching the ſecond Bill, containing miſpriſons which are not crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
the King by force of his ſubmiſſion, by his owne adviſe, and not

For firſt, here is nothing but an impeachment onely by
the Commons of a Peere, who ought to be tryed, judged by his
Peerage, not by Commoners Secondly, there was no judgement
given in Parliament in this caſe, but only a private Award made
by the King, out of the Parliament Houſe in his owne Chamber
in preſence of the Lords. Thirdly, the Lords entred a ſpeciall
proteſtation againſt it, as not made by their advice or conſent.
Fourthly, they en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both of being tryed and judged onely by their Peeres

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116421:38"/>
that the power of Iudicature and Cenſure as well of impeached
Commoners as Lords, reſides onely in the Lords Houſe; the
Commons being but <hi>generall Inquiſitors, to ſearch out and preſent
both Lords and Commoners publike offences to the Lords, to whom they
tranſmit the charge and witneſſes;</hi> the Lords the onely Iudges, to
heare and determine the charge, examine the witneſſes upon oath,

               <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and his diſciples the <hi>Levellers,</hi> is the Statute of
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> chap. 29. <hi>That no Free man ſhall be impriſoned,
outlawed, exiled, or any other way deſtroyed; Nor we ſhall not paſſe
upon him, nor condemne him, but</hi> BY THE LAWFVLL
IVDGMENT OF HIS PEERES, or BY THE LAW OF
THE LAND. Whence thus they argue: The Lords in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are not Commoners Peers, but the Commons only, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot be judged in Parliament by the Lords, but by
the Commons alone; and if Peers there judge Commoners, it
is a tyranny and uſurpation even againſt <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelfe,
though it be in caſe of priviledge.</p>
            <p>To take away this grand ſeeming objection,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and give it a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
anſwer, I ſay: Firſt, in generall, that there is ſcarce
one Parliament ever ſince <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was firſt confirmed, but
the Lords have ſentenced and given judgment againſt ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
capitally or penally in body or purſe, or both, without
the Commons (and did ſo doubtleſſe before <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was
made, as I have already manifeſted) yet never did the Commons
in any one of thoſe Parliaments till this preſent, complain of it, as
a violation of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or a tyrannicall uſurpation, as
<hi>Lilburne</hi> and <hi>Overton</hi> ſtile it; but acknowledged it as a juſt right
in the Lords, even in 3. <hi>Caroli</hi> it ſelfe when the <hi>Petition of Right</hi>
was paſſed, in the Lords Iudgment and Sentence againſt Doctor
<hi>Manwaring</hi> a Commoner, impeached by the Commons. And
therefore for this one <hi>Ignoramus</hi> alone, againſt the judgements of
all the Commons in Parliament, in all ages, to averre this a breach
of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> for impriſoning and fining him for the higheſt
affront and breach of priviledge over offered to any Parliament, is
the extremity of ignorance, malice and ſingularity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:116421:39"/>
Secondly, I anſwer, that the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not to, nor was ever intended of the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Iudgements and Proceedings, but onely to the proceedings

Charta,</hi> in cenſuring or impriſoning Commoners till now. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this miſapplying of this Law to the Parliament and Houſe of
Peers, is a groſſe overſight.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the very literall ſence of this Law is much miſtaken
by the Objectors; For that any <hi>Freeman</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is a Peer to

of an <hi>higher degree</hi> in point of honour, dignity, office, and eſtate;

               <hi>No Freeman ſhall be impriſoned,</hi> and <hi>but by the
lawfull judgement of his Peers,</hi> extends onely to exclude <hi>villaines</hi>
and thoſe who are not Freeholders from being <hi>Iudges of Freemen</hi>
and <hi>Freeholders</hi> in tryalls by <hi>Iury,</hi> (whence the Writs to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes
to ſummon Iurors, require them alwayes to returne <hi>Liberos

<hi>Freemen</hi> in the higeſt degree) to be Iudges of <hi>Commoners</hi> who are
<hi>Freemen.</hi> So as the Argument from the true meaning of this
Law can be but this, villaines and thoſe who are no Freemen are
not to be Iudges, or impannelled in Iuries to condemne Freemen,
becauſe they are not their <hi>Peeres,</hi> nor Freemen as well as they:

            <p>There is onely one objection more of moment remaining,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note>
which is this, If the Houſe of Peers may without the Commons
fine and impriſon Commoners; then if their fine and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be unjuſt and illegall, they ſhall bee remedileſſe, there being
no ſuperiour Courr to appeale unto, which will bee an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Secondly, If any ſuch cenſure be given, the party (as in Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
upon juſt grounds ſhewed may Petition the Houſe of Peers for
a reveiw and new-hearing of the cauſe, which they in juſtice nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will nor can deny; and if they doe, then the party grieved
<pb facs="tcp:116421:41"/>
may petition the Houſe ef Commons to interceed in his behal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the <hi>Peers</hi> for a rehearing; but to diſcharge or free any <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
judicially cenſured by the Lords, I have hitherto met with no
Preſident in former Parliaments, nor power in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to doe it, who cannot reverſe Euro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in admitting the Houſe of Commons to bee judges of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners;
if there bee no appeale from them to the Lords, in caſe
